March 2018 - Present
: **Software Engineer at Adobe**
I am part of the Identity Management Systems team. I worked on implementing the server side of the SCIM2 
protocol over a Spring 5 reactive stack. I have also developed a thin wrapper over Mockito and Spring TestContext
framework in order to promote writing [clean tests](https://medium.com/@andreisilviudragnea/towards-cleaner-pure-tests-20f1356dee4c).
I have massively refactored the code base towards a simpler design from the method level to the architectural level.

September 2017 - December 2017
: **Software Engineer at Instacar**
I implemented a TCP server over a proprietary binary protocol for remote car control.
Given the rather poorly maintained Python codebase, I introduced type hints and I have
developed a Pycharm [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10194-python-enhancements) for automatic detection
and removal of dead code.

I always strive the find the simplest solution possible to a problem. I am also proactive into fixing problems
from any software project that I encounter, whether it is internal to my company, or an open source project.
