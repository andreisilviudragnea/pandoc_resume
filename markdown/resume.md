March 2018 - Present
: **Software Engineer at Adobe**
I am part of the Identity Management Services team. I worked on implementing the server side of the SCIM2 
protocol over a Spring 5 reactive stack. I developed a thin wrapper over Mockito and Spring TestContext
framework in order to promote writing [clean tests](https://medium.com/@andreisilviudragnea/towards-cleaner-pure-tests-20f1356dee4c).
I introduced Kotlin and coroutines to our team, as a developer-friendly alternative for writing non-blocking code.
I made major software architectural changes by using smart refactoring tricks, resulting in a simpler system design.

September 2017 - December 2017
: **Software Engineer at Instacar**
I implemented a TCP server over a proprietary binary protocol for remote car control.
I introduced type hints to the Python 3 codebase, and I developed a Pycharm [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10194-python-enhancements)
for dead code elimination.

I always strive the find the simplest solution possible to a problem. I proactively fix problems
from any software project that I encounter, whether it is internal to my company, or an open source project.
